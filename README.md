# Wave

**Wave** is a lightweight, cross-platform, and portable music player built with modern technologies.  
It focuses on **performance**, **simplicity**, and **offline-first usage**, while remaining easily extensible for advanced audio features.

---

## Features

- Local music library (folder-based)
- High-performance audio playback
- Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android)
- Portable & lightweight (no heavy runtime)
- Designed for future EQ & DSP extensions
- Offline-first (no server required)

---

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **Vite**

### App Shell
- **Tauri** (lightweight native shell)

### Backend / Audio Engine
- **Rust**
- **Rodio** + **Symphonia** + **CPAL** – desktop playback
- **Media3 ExoPlayer** (JNI) – Android playback (`content://` / SAF-friendly)

### Storage
- **SQLite** – music library, playlists, settings

### Backend Layout Notes

- The backend lives in `src-tauri/`; `tauri.conf.json` is inside that directory, not at the repository root.
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` is the GUI/backend composition root where state and Tauri commands are registered.
- `src-tauri/src/main.rs` selects between GUI mode, CLI mode, and the playback daemon at startup.
- `src/utils/player.ts` is the frontend-facing wrapper around the backend command surface.
- Detailed backend API docs live in `docs/backend/README.md`.
- Android ExoPlayer + SAF details: [`docs/backend/android.md`](docs/backend/android.md).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (LTS)
- **Rust**
- **Cargo**
- **Git**

Verify installation:

```bash
node -v
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

---

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

### Run in Development Mode

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

This will start both the frontend and the native backend.

---

## Build for Production

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

The final portable binaries will be generated for your platform.

---

## Design Goals

- **Fast startup**
- **Low memory usage**
- **Clean architecture**
- **No unnecessary dependencies**
- **Long-term maintainability**
